350|Reports|Tax Reports|2|agent|MAT Applicability Analysis - FY2025-26: Company tax regime: Section 115BAA (New Concessional Rate 22% + surcharge + cess = 25.168%). KEY FINDING: Companies opting for Section 115BAA are EXEMPT from MAT (Section 115JB does not apply). Therefore MAT is NOT applicable to your company. For information purposes only: Book Profit (as would be computed under Section 115JB): Net Profit as per P&L ₹22.8 Cr + Adjustments (DTL, provisions, etc.) ₹2.1 Cr = Book Profit ₹24.9 Cr. MAT @ 15% + cess would have been: ₹3.96 Cr. Your normal tax liability ₹4.27 Cr > Hypothetical MAT ₹3.96 Cr - so MAT would not have applied even if you were in old regime. No MAT Credit entitlement exists. No action required on MAT front.||capable|/reports/tax/mat-analysis|[reports, tax_analytics]|[pnl_data, book_profit_data]|analytical_summary|false|MAT not applicable as company opted for Section 115BAA new concessional regime - confirmed with hypothetical calculation
