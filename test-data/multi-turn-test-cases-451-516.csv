Some of our credit notes show different amounts than the original invoices.|unified|cheap|[eway_bill, returns, compliance]|[return_eway_bill_rules, credit_notes]|[gst_rules]|informational|false|Explained that return eway bills use the actual return value (not negative) and document type is set to Sales Return or Purchase Return. Credit note value may differ from eway bill if partial return.
456|Eway Bills|Return Logistics|2|agent|||||||| |false|Return eway bill value handling: (1) Eway bills always carry positive values - the system uses document type Return/Credit Note to indicate return nature. (2) If partial return, eway bill value = value of goods actually being returned (not full invoice value). (3) Credit note amount may differ from eway bill value because: credit note includes freight deduction or price adjustment; or goods returned in multiple lots. (4) For GST purposes, credit note value governs tax reversal; eway bill value governs movement compliance. (5) If return value exceeds ₹50,000, eway bill is mandatory regardless of whether full or partial return. Always reconcile credit note amount with eway bill value monthly.

Return logistics compliance = 78.6% (industry benchmark: 88%). Gap analysis: Return logistics lags by 15.8 percentage points. Root causes: (1) Customers initiate return without coordinating eway bill with us (42% of gaps). (2) Return eway bill generated after goods already dispatched by customer (31% of gaps). (3) Return value below threshold (but goods included non-threshold items together) (27% of gaps). Recommendations: (1) Send return eway bill instructions to customers at time of credit note approval. (2) Block credit note from being posted without return EWB reference. (3) Train customer service team on return logistics compliance.

457|Eway Bills|Multi-vehicle Consolidation|1|agent|||||||| |false|Consolidated eway bill (CEWB) rules: (1) Transporter can generate CEWB by consolidating multiple individual EWBs of the same vehicle. (2) CEWB is a transport document - individual EWBs must still be generated per invoice. (3) Maximum 500 EWBs can be consolidated into one CEWB. (4) CEWB validity is derived from the shortest validity among consolidated EWBs. (5) If one EWB in CEWB expires, all goods in that vehicle are technically non-compliant. (6) CEWB can be generated only by the transporter (not supplier/recipient). (7) Benefit: Checkpost officers verify CEWB instead of 50 individual EWBs - speeds up clearance by 60-70%.

ITC-04 reports job work movements and must be filed separately based on challan data, not eway bill data.
457|Eway Bills|Multi-vehicle Consolidation|3|agent|||||||| |false|CEWB and ITC-04 relationship: (1) ITC-04 reports goods sent to and received from job workers - it is based on delivery challans, not eway bills. CEWB does not affect ITC-04 filing. (2) However, if job work goods are consolidated in CEWB with commercial goods, ensure challan numbers are correctly referenced in individual EWBs before consolidation. (3) CEWB value limits: No explicit value limit per CEWB but individual EWB rules apply (₹50,000 threshold per EWB). (4) If a CEWB includes job work challans, the challan number must appear in the source EWB, not in the CEWB itself. (5) Best practice: Keep job work EWBs separate from commercial supply EWBs when consolidating.

467|drive_document_management|document_workflow_automation|1|user|How do I automate document routing for approvals in HelloBooks? I want purchase invoices to automatically go to the right approver.|unified|cheap|[drive > workflow, documents > automation]|[drive, documents]|[workflow_setup, approval_routing, automation_rules]|informational|false|HelloBooks document workflow automation works through configurable rule-based routing. For purchase invoice approval, you define conditions such as invoice amount range, vendor category, cost center, or expense type; then specify the approver or approval chain. For example, invoices below Rs 50,000 route to Department Head, Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakhs route to Finance Manager, above Rs 5 lakhs route to CFO. Workflows support sequential approval (A then B) or parallel approval (A and B simultaneously). Escalation rules trigger if approver does not act within defined SLA (e.g., 48 hours). I can help you set up specific workflow rules right now.

503|Industry|Trading Inventory|5|agent|||||||| |false|EOQ calculation for SKU-A01: Annual demand (D): 3,600 units (avg 300/month × 12). Ordering cost (S): ₹2,500 per order (admin, shipping, handling). Holding cost (H): ₹88/unit/year (10% of ₹880 unit cost - storage, insurance, capital). EOQ formula: √(2DS/H) = √(2 × 3600 × 2500 / 88) = √204,545 = 452 units. Optimal order: 452 units (~8 orders/year). Reorder point: Lead time 7 days × daily demand 10 = 70 units + safety stock 30 = 100 units. Current practice: Ordering 600 units, 6 times/year. Recommendation: Switch to EOQ ordering pattern.

508|AI Features|Smart Insights|1|agent|||||||| |false|HelloBooks AI Business Insights Dashboard: Financial Health: Cash runway 4.2 months (⚠ below 6-month target), Debt-to-equity 0.8 (healthy), Working capital positive ₹42L. Revenue Insights: MoM growth +8.2% (trending up), Customer concentration risk (top 3 = 38%), Seasonal pattern detected (Q3 peak). Cost Insights: Unusual spike in logistics costs (+22% vs avg), Material costs tracking inflation, Payroll efficiency improving. Predictive Alerts: "March cash flow may be tight due to advance tax + low collection month historically", "Customer XYZ payment behavior deteriorating - 45% chance of delay", "Based on current trends, you'll exceed travel budget by ₹1.2L". Anomaly Detection: 3 transactions flagged for review (unusual vendor, amount pattern). Natural language: Ask me anything like "Why did profit drop in January?" or "Which products are losing money?".
508|AI Features|Smart Insights|2|user|Analyze why our gross margin dropped from 32% to 28% between Q2 and Q3|unified|capable|/ai/margin_analysis|[ai,analytics]|[profitability_data,cost_breakdown]|analysis|false|
508|AI Features|Smart Insights|2|agent|||||||| |false|Gross margin analysis Q2 vs Q3: Q2 margin: 32.1%, Q3 margin: 27.8%. Drop: 4.3 percentage points (₹18.4L impact). Root cause analysis: 1. Raw material cost increase (2.1% impact): Steel prices +14% in Aug, Copper +9%. Volume couldn't be passed to customers immediately. 2. Product mix shift (1.4% impact): Higher sales of lower-margin products (Economy line +28% share vs -8% for Premium). 3. Pricing pressure (0.5% impact): Competitive discount offered to retain 2 large customers. 4. Production inefficiency (0.3% impact): New machine learning curve, higher scrap rate in Sep. Offsetting factors: Volume increase +12% limited overall profit impact. Recommendations: (1) Price increase 3-4% for Q4, (2) Push premium products with sales incentives, (3) Commodity hedging for next quarter. Recovery projected: 30.5% margin in Q4 if actions taken.

508|AI Features|Smart Insights|3|agent|||||||| |false|AI Cash Flow Prediction (Mar-May 2025): Model: LSTM neural network trained on 36 months history + seasonality + known commitments. March: Opening ₹45L → Closing ₹28L (⚠ Low). Inflows ₹1.62Cr (collections slower - year-end customer delays). Outflows ₹1.79Cr (Advance tax ₹18L, Salary ₹52L, Vendor payments ₹1.09Cr). April: Opening ₹28L → Closing ₹52L. Inflows ₹1.84Cr (Q4 collections accelerate). Outflows ₹1.6Cr (normal). May: Opening ₹52L → Closing ₹71L. Inflows ₹1.72Cr. Outflows ₹1.53Cr. Confidence: 85% within ±12% range. Key risk: March week 3 may hit ₹12L (below ₹15L threshold). Scenario if top customer delays: March closing drops to ₹18L. Recommendation: Arrange ₹20L OD buffer for March, accelerate Feb collections.

Data volume: 12,847 transactions. Issue: Large dataset + complex filters. Quick fixes: 1. Reduce date range: Try quarterly instead of annual (4x faster). 2. Remove unnecessary columns: Disable columns you don't need. 3. Use summary report: Sales Summary is 10x faster than detailed register. 4. Schedule report: Run overnight, download in morning. 5. Export to Excel: For large reports, export and analyze offline. System-side optimizations (I can enable): Archive old transactions (>2 years) - reduces active dataset. Enable report caching - subsequent runs faster. Upgrade to dedicated server (Enterprise plan) - 3x performance. Browser tips: Use Chrome/Edge (faster than others), Clear cache, Close other tabs.
