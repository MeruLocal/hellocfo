FIFO would cause profit volatility.\n2. **Tax efficiency:** WA gives slightly lower inventory valuation (₹52K less) = lower reported profit = lower tax.\n3. **Simplicity:** Your team is familiar with WA. FIFO requires tracking cost layers per batch.\n4. **Industry norm:** Most Indian textile/trading companies use WA.\n\n**When to consider FIFO:**\n- If you need to track exact margins per batch\n- If input prices are rising rapidly (>10% quarterly)\n- If auditors or investors request batch-level costing\n\nThe ₹52,000 valuation difference is only 3.4% — not significant enough to justify a method change.\n\nWould you like to discuss this with your auditor or make any valuation adjustments?|unified|capable|follow_up→reuse_tools→mcp_call→llm→response|inventory|recommendation,benchmark_comparison|narrative_insight|false|Recommends continuing weighted average based on business profile analysis covering price volatility, tax efficiency, and industry norms with conditions for reconsidering FIFO
