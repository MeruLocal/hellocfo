445|Budgeting|Zero-Based Budgeting|1|agent||||||||||Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Approach for Overhead Costs: ZBB requires every rupee of expenditure to be justified afresh rather than using last year as base. Step 1 - Define decision units: Each overhead function (HR, Finance, IT, Admin, Legal) becomes a decision unit. Step 2 - Create decision packages: For each function, build minimum service level package (say 70% of current spend) and enhancement packages. Step 3 - Rank packages by value delivered. Step 4 - Fund packages until budget is exhausted. Key benefits: Eliminates cost creep; Challenges entrenched spending; Typically delivers 10-25% overhead savings. Recommended scope for FY 2026-27: Admin, HR, and IT (₹28 Cr combined). Exclude direct costs from ZBB - apply to overheads only.

445|Budgeting|Zero-Based Budgeting|5|agent||||||||||ZBB Implementation - Challenges and Lessons Learned: Key Challenges: 1. Change resistance - Department heads viewed ZBB as cost-cutting exercise rather than value optimization; 2 departments submitted inflated baselines. 2. Data quality - Historical cost data at activity level was poor; took 3 weeks to clean data. 3. Time and effort - ZBB process took 40% more time than traditional budgeting; capacity strain on finance team. 4. Decision package calibration - Difficulty defining minimum service levels objectively. 5. Cross-functional dependencies - Cutting one department's budget impacted service levels to others. Lessons Learned for FY 2026-27: Start 2 months earlier (kick off in February vs April). Secure MD and CEO visible sponsorship. Apply ZBB only to top 15 cost categories (80% of overhead spend). Invest in HelloBooks activity-based cost module before starting. Train department heads with workshop in January. Use prior year benchmarks for sanity checking minimum packages.

448|Budgeting|Overhead Allocation|1|user|Can you explain our overhead cost allocation methodology? We are getting questions from business unit heads about how overheads are charged to them.|unified|capable|[budgeting, cost_accounting]|[overhead_allocation, methodology]|[cost_allocation, ABC]|text|false|Explains overhead allocation methodology using a two-stage approach: first pooling overheads into cost centres (HR, Finance, IT, Admin), then allocating to business units using appropriate allocation bases like headcount, floor area, and IT usage metrics.
448|Budgeting|Overhead Allocation|1|agent||||||||||Overhead Allocation Methodology Overview: Our company uses a Two-Stage Cost Allocation approach. Stage 1 - Overhead Pooling: All indirect costs are grouped into 5 service cost centres: HR Services Pool, Finance and Accounts Pool, IT Services Pool, Admin and Facilities Pool, Legal and Compliance Pool. Stage 2 - Allocation to Business Units: Each pool is allocated to the 3 BUs (Enterprise, SME, Export) using specific allocation bases. HR Pool (₹8.20 Cr) - Allocated by headcount; Enterprise 45%, SME 35%, Export 20%. Finance Pool (₹4.20 Cr) - Allocated by revenue contribution; Enterprise 48%, SME 32%, Export 20%. IT Pool (₹8.80 Cr) - Allocated by IT user licenses and server utilization. Admin Pool (₹5.60 Cr) - Allocated by floor area occupied. Legal Pool (₹2.70 Cr) - Allocated 60% direct, 40% by revenue. Total overhead allocated: ₹29.50 Cr. The methodology is reviewed annually and approved by the CFO.

The SME team is complaining it is too high.|unified|capable|[budgeting, cost_accounting]|[shared_services, allocation_basis]|[equitable_allocation, review]|table|false|Reviews shared services allocation basis and fairness assessment showing SME BU bears 35% of HR costs (₹2.87 Cr) but generates only 28% of revenue, suggesting headcount-based allocation may be slightly inequitable. Recommends blended basis using headcount plus revenue.
448|Budgeting|Overhead Allocation|2|agent||||||||||Shared Services Allocation Equity Review: Current Allocation vs Revenue Contribution Comparison: Enterprise BU - Revenue share 48%; HR allocation 45%; Finance allocation 48%; IT allocation 42%; Net overhead charged ₹13.28 Cr; Overhead as % of BU revenue 9.8%. SME BU - Revenue share 32%; HR allocation 35%; Finance allocation 32%; IT allocation 38%; Net overhead ₹10.32 Cr; Overhead as % of BU revenue 13.5%. Export BU - Revenue share 20%; HR allocation 20%; Finance allocation 20%; IT allocation 20%; Net overhead ₹5.90 Cr; Overhead as % of BU revenue 12.4%. Assessment: SME overhead burden is disproportionately high at 13.5% vs revenue share. IT allocation (38%) vs revenue (32%) is the main driver - SME has higher per-user IT cost. Recommendation: Blend headcount and revenue for IT allocation (50:50). Projected SME saving: ₹0.80 Cr annually.
